    How do hsla colors work in a mask?
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Let's go back for a moment to the HSLA color we used in our mask.
  </p>

  <!-- TE note light-->
  <div
    class="mb-8 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-gray-500 border-opacity-50 bg-gray-100 p-5 dark:bg-gray-700">
    <p class="">
      In fact, we could use color in any format. HEXA or RGBA color will work
      just as well. However, I recommend that you always use HSLA colors,
      because it is the easiest to adjust them when creating a design. We will
      learn more about this in future lessons.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="mb-5">
    HSLA stands for Hue, Saturation, Lightness, and Alpha. It is a way to
    represent colors in CSS.
  </p>

  <ol class="list-decimal pl-4">
    <li class="mb-3">
      <p>
        <strong>Hue (H)</strong>: This is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to
        360. 0 (or 360) is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue. So, you can
        select a base color by moving around the color wheel.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <p>
        <strong>Saturation (S)</strong>: This is a percentage value, 0% means a
        shade of gray (no color - achromatic), and 100% is the full color.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <p>
        <strong>Lightness (L)</strong>: Also a percentage; 0% lightness is
        black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is "normal."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <p>
        <strong>Alpha (A)</strong>: This is an optional parameter that defines
        the opacity of the color. It's a number between 0.0 (completely
        transparent) and 1.0 (completely opaque).
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
